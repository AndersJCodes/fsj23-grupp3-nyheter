## Description
This project is a news site about Javascript, CSS, HTML, and React. The news is retrieved with Axios from an open news API called News API. 
The user can sort the news by date, get the latest articles within a category, mark the news as a favorite, and save it in his account. The user can also find news by searching for a keyword. All functions that need to be saved use Firebase. The site is published at Github Pages and tracked and analyzed in Google Analytics.
