## Description
This project is a news site about Javascript, CSS, HTML, and React. The news is retrieved with Axios from an open news API called News API. 
The user can sort the news by date, get the latest articles within a category, mark the news as a favorite, and save it in his account. The favorites will be saved in local storage.The user can also find news by searching for a keyword. You can register and log in on the page by Firebase. If you go offline the page will contain some content by the service worker. The service worker will also help to load the page faster for a more user-friendly experience. The site is published at Github Pages and tracked and analyzed in Google Analytics.
